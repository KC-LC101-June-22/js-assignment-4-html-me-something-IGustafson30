               <h2>What are ferrets?</h2>
               <p id="testP">
                  Ferrets are often seen as whimsical rodents that get a bad rep for having a musky odor and thieving habits that would put Jessie James to shame. However, there’s so much to these amazing creatures and their important roles that they’ve played alongside humans in history.
                  For starters, it's a common misconception that ferrets are rodents, which they aren’t. Ferrets are the domesticated version of the European polecat and they hail from the <i>Musteliade</i> family. This family includes siblings such as weasels, badgers, otters, and even wolverines! Ferrets derive their name from the Latin word furittus, meaning “little thief.” This is an extremely apt name due to the fact that ferrets have an innate nature to take and stash anything they can get their paws on.

               <h2>History of Ferrets</h2>
               <p>
                  Ferrets are thought to have been domesticated roughly 2,500 years ago. They were initially used as sport to hunt rabbits and rodents due to their unique physical characteristics, allowing them to be excellent at pursuing prey in small and tight areas such as a rabbit’s burrow. Since their domestication their popularity amongst higher class individuals rose as pets and status items, as seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s 1489-1491 painting,<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Lady_with_an_Ermine_-_Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/240px-Lady_with_an_Ermine_-_Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">“Lady with an Ermine.”</a> During the 1700’s when the pilgrims were coming to what was to become America, it was common to house ferrets on the ships alongside cats since the ferret could much more effectively chase and eradicate vermin on the ship. During World War II it was very common in the American West to use ferrets in a similar manner, to protect grain stores from rodents. Ferrets are also accredited to helping develop influenza vaccines since they’re susceptible to the same human influenza virus and it's symptoms.

               <p>
                  With ferrets being among some of the most popular pets, after dogs and cats in America, it is surprising how little people know of them! Here are a few fun facts that you may not have known:
                  <ul>
                     <li>The Latin name for a domesticated ferret is <i>Mustela putorius</i>, meaning smelly weasel.</li>
                     <li>Ferrets do have a slight musky odor but this can be minimized by spaying or neutering and feeding the ferret a raw diet over a kibble diet.</li>
                     <li>Speaking of smell, ferrets have incredible olfactory organs allowing them to be expert hunters in dark and expansive burrows of rabbits.</li>
                     <li>Ferrets sleep on average 16 hours a day! They are crepuscular, which means that they are mostly active during dusk and dawn. However when kept as pets they will adjust their sleeping schedule to match that of the owner’s.</li>
                     <li>Why would a ferret change its sleeping schedule to match the owners? It’s simple, domesticated ferrets are very social animals and love to play, explore, snuggle and nap together. It is for this reason that it’s highly recommended to consider getting two ferrets as opposed to one, if considering them as pets. </li>
                     <li>Ferrets have been used on multiple occasions to run wire &amp; cables in historical buildings to minimize the damage done to such locations. They have also run wire &amp; cable for many other applications.</li>
                     <li>A group of Ferrets is called a business.</li>
                  </ul>
